# Codex is building a Decentralized Durability Engine

## What is Codex?

Codex is aiming to solve the fundamental issues of data durability in decentralized systems

## How does it work?

**Redundancy**

We achieve this with the use of erasure coding techniques, which are overall superior to replication and have additional properties that contribute to durability.

**Uncorrelatedness**

We achieve this with data placement techniques that minimize the likelyhood of data loss when a node or group of nodes fail.

**Repair**

We use data auditing techniques to detect and repair data loss, thus maintaining expected levels of redundancy.

**Auditing**

We rely on cryptographic techniques that detect data loss at scale in very large datasets and operate in byzantine environments.

**Incentives**

We use incentives to compensate for resources contributed to the system and increase it's overall sustainability.
