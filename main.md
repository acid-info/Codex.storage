Codex is a decentralized file storage network.
Whilst p2p storage networks have been around for quite a long time, the lack of incentives, strong data availability, and persistence guarantees make these networks unsuitable for 
applications with moderate to high availability requirements. In other words, without reliability at the storage layer it is impossible to build other reliable applications on top of it. Codex aims to solve this by supplying:

* An incentivized p2p storage network with strong availability and persistence guarantees.
* A resource restricted friendly protocol that can endure higher levels of churn and large amounts of ephemeral devices.

> Codex has a working PoC available on request, and is expected to be in production by 2023. 

This first use case is a decentralized file storage network on the Logos network.
Users are incentivized to store data on Codex by earning CODX, which is the native cryptocurrency of the network. 
Users can also stake their CODX in order to earn staking rewards and unlock additional functionality. 

Codex is building a sustainable network of storage nodes through incentivised participation;
enable data durability through proof based storage incentives and churn-resistant redundancy;
provide a new storage engine that can equally be used for private and public storage, and to support
distributed Web3 applications; support the participation of light-weight clients such as mobile phones;
