# Codex is building a Decentralized Durability Engine

## What is Codex?

Codex is aiming to solve the fundamental issues of data durability in decentralized systems

Codex is a research group working in all areas of decentralized storage.

Codex is a decentralized storage protocol for durable information. 

Whilst p2p storage networks have been around for quite a long time, the lack of incentives, strong data availability, and durability guarantees make these networks unsuitable for a wide array of applications.  In other words, without durablity at the storage layer it is impossible to build reliable applications.
