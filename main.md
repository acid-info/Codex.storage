# What is Codex?

- Codex is aiming to solve the fundamental issues of data durability in decentralized systems

# How does it work?

#### Redundancy
we achieve this with the use of erasure coding techniques, which are overall superior to replication and have additional properties that contribute to durability.
#### Uncorrelatedness
we achieve this with data placement techniques that minimize the likelyhood of data loss when a node or group of nodes fail.
#### Repair
we use data auditing techniques to detect and repair data loss, thus maintaining expected levels of redundancy.
#### Auditing 
we rely on cryptographic techniques to detect data loss at scale in very large datasets and operate in byzantine environments.
#### Incentives
we use incentives to compensate for resources contributed to the system and increase it's overall sustainability.
