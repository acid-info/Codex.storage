## About Codex

Codex is a research group working in all areas of decentralized storage.

Codex is a decentralized storage protocol for durable information. Whilst p2p storage networks have been around for quite a long time, the lack of incentives, strong data availability, and durability guarantees make these networks unsuitable for a wide array of applications.  In other words, without durablity at the storage layer it is impossible to build reliable applications.

Codex aims to solve this by supplying an incentivized p2p storage network with strong availability and durability guarantees, and a resource restricted friendly protocol that can endure higher levels of churn and large amounts of ephemeral devices.
