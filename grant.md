# Codex Undergraduate and Graduate Student Internship Program



The **Codex Internship Program (CIP)** is aimed at undergraduate and graduate students looking to gain some experience and do research and development in one of the domains of interest related to the Codex project. The grant is intended to help students gain visibility on their field of interest and at the same time allow them to learn about common research and development practices that should be beneficial for their continuing careers.

## Research interests

The CIP aims to do research and development in, but not limited to:

 * Decentralized storage systems
 * Erasure coding optimizations for large-scale distributed storage
 * Proof or data retrievability and other storage related proofs
 * Game theory in the context of incentivized storage
 * Storage performance measurement and testing

## Eligibility 

This program is available to undergraduate and graduate students officially enrolled on a university, pursuing their B.Sc. or M.Sc. in the field of Computer Sciences.

## The grant

The CIP is very flexible and adapts to different levels of experience as well as to different internship lengths. The following numbers are just indicative, as the final stipend might slightly change depending on the student experience as well as to adapt to differing regions' cost. For an officially enrolled *graduate student*, the CIP offers a student stipend in the range of **$3,000/month**. For an officially enrolled *undergraduate student*, the CIP offers an student stipend in the amount of **$2,000/month**. 

In addition, the CIP might also offer some mobility grants to attend Codex meetings and related conferences that are within the scope of the research field of the student.

## Research Methodology

A member of the Codex team will be assigned as supervisor of the student for the duration of the internship. Students will be invited to participate in weekly meetings to discuss the progress done and raise questions or concerns. 

A clear end-of-internship deliverable will be given to the student depending on the length and complexity of the project. This could be a software, a report, a talk, among others.

## Application

To submit your application, please send the following documents to **cip-codex@status.im**:

 * Updated Curriculum Vitae
